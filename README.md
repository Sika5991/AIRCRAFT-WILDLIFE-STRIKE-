# Aircraft Wildlife Strike Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing aircraft wildlife strike incidents sourced from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wildlife Strike Database. The project aims to provide insights into bird species involved, regional patterns, and statistical correlations with aircraft models to enhance aviation safety measures.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of aircraft wildlife strike data to address key questions such as:

- What bird species are most frequently involved in strikes?
- Which regions experience the highest strike rates per capita?
- Is there a significant relationship between aircraft models and strike frequency?
- How has the volume of strikes changed over time?
- When do strikes most commonly occur throughout the year?

## Data Sources

The data for this analysis was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dianaddx/aircraft-wildlife-strikes-1990-2023) and consists of reports on wildlife strikes involving aircraft, including incident dates, locations, aircraft details, and species involved.

## Code Overview

The analysis is conducted using Python programming language, leveraging libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

- `data_cleaning.ipynb`: Notebook containing data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Notebook containing exploratory data analysis and statistical tests.
- `data_visualization.ipynb`: Notebook containing data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis or explore the code further, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the order mentioned above to replicate the analysis.

## Results

Key findings from the analysis include:
- Identification of top bird species involved in strikes.
- Regional patterns revealing areas with high strike rates.
- Statistical insights into the relationship between aircraft models and strike frequency.
